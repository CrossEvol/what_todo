[Origin WhatTodo](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/WhatTodo) <br/>
the project is not build on the [bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/), I want to rebuild it to `flutter_bloc`

# Todo:
- mobile can not update title properly, it will commit updateTask several times, and preserve the origin at the db level
- remove origin bloc logic which is coupled with add_task , edit_task , completed_tasks, uncompleted_tasks
