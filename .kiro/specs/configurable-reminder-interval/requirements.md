# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will allow users to configure the interval at which the app checks for reminders to send notifications. Currently, the reminder check interval is hardcoded to 15 minutes, but users should be able to customize this based on their preferences for notification frequency and battery optimization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure how often the app checks for reminders, so that I can balance notification timeliness with battery usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the settings page THEN the system SHALL display a reminder interval configuration option
2. WHEN the user selects a reminder interval THEN the system SHALL provide options including 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours
3. WHEN the user changes the reminder interval THEN the system SHALL save the new setting to the database
4. WHEN the user changes the reminder interval THEN the system SHALL restart the WorkManager with the new interval
5. IF no interval is configured THEN the system SHALL default to 15 minutes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to respect my chosen reminder interval immediately, so that the changes take effect without requiring an app restart.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user saves a new reminder interval THEN the system SHALL cancel the existing WorkManager periodic task
2. WHEN the existing task is cancelled THEN the system SHALL register a new periodic task with the updated interval
3. WHEN the new task is registered THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation message to the user
4. IF the WorkManager registration fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and revert to the previous setting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my current reminder interval setting, so that I know how frequently the app is checking for reminders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the settings page THEN the system SHALL display the currently selected reminder interval
2. WHEN no interval has been previously set THEN the system SHALL show "15 minutes" as the default
3. WHEN the user views the setting THEN the system SHALL clearly label it as "Reminder Check Interval" or similar

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the reminder interval to be stored as a setting, so that it persists across app restarts and can be easily managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL read the reminder interval setting from the database
2. WHEN initializing WorkManager THEN the system SHALL use the stored interval value instead of the hardcoded 15 minutes
3. IF no setting exists in the database THEN the system SHALL create a default setting of 15 minutes
4. WHEN the setting is retrieved THEN the system SHALL validate it is within acceptable bounds (15 minutes to 4 hours)
